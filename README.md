# Raspored štanda (Smotra Sveučilišta u Splitu)

A small web app where each faculty of the University of Split lays out the back wall of its
stand (panels 1–4) and sends the result to the organiser as one ZIP file.

- The faculty is chosen from a dropdown. That sets the colour of every panel (1–8) and the
  name on the header boards (11 + 12); exhibitors can't change either.
- Only the back wall is edited in 2D. Side walls (5–8) are shown in the floor plan and the
  3D preview, in the faculty colour.
- Everything is measured in millimetres, so the app can warn when an image is too low-resolution
  for its printed size.
- "Ostali materijali" takes any files the faculty wants on the stand without saying where.
- "Pošalji organizatoru" downloads the ZIP and opens a pre-filled email (mail app, Gmail or
  Outlook). The site has no server, so the user attaches the ZIP themselves; browsers that can
  share files also offer to attach it directly.
- Work is autosaved in the visitor's browser (IndexedDB). Nothing is uploaded anywhere.

## What the organiser receives

`smotra-<ustanova>.zip` contains:

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `sazetak.txt` | Human-readable list of every element per panel, with positions in mm |
| `raspored.json` | The same data for tools, plus the editor state |
| `datoteke/` | Original files of images placed on the wall, untouched |
| `materijali/` | "Ostali materijali": files with no set place |
| `pregled/` | Preview PNGs of the whole stand and each panel (not for print) |

Open a ZIP with **Učitaj ZIP** to see the layout in the editor.

## Before going live

In `src/event.ts`, replace each faculty's `color` with its official colour (they are
placeholders taken from the day colours on the printed schedule).

## Changing the stand

Sizes, panel order, which walls are editable and print thresholds live in `src/booth.ts`.
Event details and the faculty list live in `src/event.ts`.

## Running and deploying

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # static site in dist/
```

`dist/` is a plain static site (relative paths), so it can be uploaded to Netlify,
GitHub Pages or any web host.
